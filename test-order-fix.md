# Order Confirmation Fix - Testing Guide

## Problem Fixed
The order confirmation page was showing **hardcoded mock data** instead of real order details from the database.

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Wrong Order Items**: Was showing "Organic Apple" and "Lemongrass Essential Oil" (hardcoded)
2. **Wrong Shipping Address**: Was showing "John Doe, 123 Main Street, Delhi" (hardcoded)
3. **Wrong Order Total**: Was showing ₹1250 (hardcoded)
4. **Missing Real Data**: Not fetching actual order details from API

## Changes Made:

### 1. Updated Order Confirmation Page (`/app/order-confirmation/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed hardcoded mock data
- ✅ Added API call to fetch real order details
- ✅ Added proper loading and error states
- ✅ Enhanced order display with price breakdown
- ✅ Added phone number to shipping address
- ✅ Improved item display with unit information

### 2. Updated Orders API (`/app/api/orders/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added support for searching orders by order number
- ✅ Enhanced query parameters for order lookup

### 3. Fixed Environment Configuration
- ✅ Updated NEXTAUTH_URL to match current port (3001)

## How to Test:

### Step 1: Login to the Application
1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Click "Login" and sign in with Google
3. Make sure you're authenticated

### Step 2: Add Items to Cart
1. Go to Products page
2. Add some items to your cart
3. Verify items appear in cart

### Step 3: Complete Checkout Process
1. Go to Cart and click "Proceed to Checkout"
2. Fill in shipping address details:
   - Full Name: Your name
   - Phone: Your phone number
   - Address: Your complete address
   - City, State, Pincode
3. Select "Cash on Delivery" payment method
4. Click "Place Order"

### Step 4: Verify Order Confirmation
The order confirmation page should now show:
- ✅ **Real order details** (not mock data)
- ✅ **Actual items** you added to cart
- ✅ **Your shipping address** (not John Doe's)
- ✅ **Correct order total** with breakdown
- ✅ **Real order number** (TOFA + timestamp)
- ✅ **Your phone number** in shipping details

### Expected Results:
- Order confirmation shows YOUR actual order details
- Items match what you added to cart
- Shipping address matches what you entered
- Order total reflects real calculation
- Email notification sent to admin
- Cart is cleared after order

## Technical Details:

### API Flow:
1. **Order Creation**: `POST /api/orders` creates order in database
2. **Order Lookup**: `GET /api/orders?orderNumber=TOFA123...` fetches order details
3. **Data Transformation**: Order data transformed for display
4. **Real-time Display**: Order confirmation shows actual data

### Error Handling:
- Loading state while fetching order details
- Error message if order not found
- Fallback to shopping if order lookup fails

## Before vs After:

### Before (Broken):
```
Order ID: TOFA1725782534123
Items: Organic Apple × 2, Lemongrass Essential Oil × 1  (WRONG!)
Address: John Doe, 123 Main Street, Delhi  (WRONG!)
Total: ₹1250  (WRONG!)
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Order ID: TOFA1725782534123
Items: [Your actual cart items]  ✅
Address: [Your actual shipping address]  ✅
Total: [Your actual order total]  ✅
```

The order confirmation page now correctly displays the real order details that were just created, providing an accurate summary of the customer's purchase.
